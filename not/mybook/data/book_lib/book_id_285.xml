	Dart in Action introduces Google\'s Dart language and provides techniques and examples showing how to use it as a viable replacement for Java and JavaScript in browser-based desktop and mobile applications. It begins with a rapid overview of Dart language and tools, including features like interacting with the browser, optional typing, classes, libraries, and concurrency with isolates. After you master the core concepts, you\'ll move on to running Dart on the server and creating single page HTML5 web applications.
