		Java remains the global standard for developing various applications and enterprise software, and the launch of Java 7 brings with it exciting new capabilities for concurrent programming by way of the concurrency utilities enhancement. This allows developers to make the most of their applications with parallel task performance. “Java 7 Concurrency Cookbook” covers all elements of the Java concurrency API, providing essential recipes for taking advantage of the exciting new capabilities.

	<p>
		On your computer, you can listen to music while you edit a Word document and read your emails, all at once! This is because your operating system allows the concurrency of tasks, much like the Java platform which offers various classes to execute concurrent tasks inside a Java program. “Java 7 Concurrency Cookbook” covers the most important features of the Java concurrency API, with special emphasis on the new capabilities of version 7.
	</p>
	<p>
		With each version, Java increases the available functionality to facilitate development of concurrent programs. This book covers the most important and useful mechanisms included in version 7 of the Java concurrency API, so you will be able to use them directly in your applications.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Java 7 Concurrency Cookbook” includes recipes to enable you to achieve everything from the basic management of threads and tasks, to the new Fork /Join framework, through synchronization mechanisms between tasks, different types of concurrent tasks that Java can execute, data structures that must be used in concurrent applications and the classes of the library that can be customized.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the step-by-step examples in this book you’ll be able to apply the most important and useful features of the Java 7 concurrency API.
