	The Spring Framework has found a very strong user base over the years. Software&amp;nbsp;houses and enterprises found the framework to be the best fit for their plumbing needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Surprisingly, the core principle that Spring has been built for—the Dependency Injec-tion (DI)—is very simple to understand. This chapter discusses the fundamentals of&amp;nbsp;the framework from a high ground. It helps the reader understand the dependency&amp;nbsp;injection principles. The chapter opens up with a simple problem of object coupling&amp;nbsp;and dependencies. It then explains how to solve the them using Spring Framework.
